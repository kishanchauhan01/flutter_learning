    # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
    assets:
      - assets/images/
      - assets/images/

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    #
    fonts:
        - family: Poppins
          fonts:
              - asset: assets\fonts\poppins\Poppins-Regular.ttf
